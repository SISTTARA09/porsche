							<h3>rally</h3>
							<p>
								<img src="./images/rally.png" width="200" alt="[rally]" />
								&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;Porsche has a rich history in rally
								racing, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. The most
								notable Porsche rally car from that era is the Porsche 911,
								which achieved significant success in various rally
								championships. In the early 1960s, the Porsche 356 was the first
								Porsche model to participate in rallies. It competed in events
								such as the Monte Carlo Rally and the Tour de France Automobile.
								However, it was the introduction of the Porsche 911 in 1963 that
								truly marked Porsche's entry into the rally scene. The Porsche
								911 quickly gained a reputation for its performance and
								reliability, making it a popular choice for rally teams. Porsche
								developed different versions of the 911 specifically for
								rallying, such as the 911S and the 911 Carrera RS. These cars
								featured modified suspensions, reinforced chassis, and increased
								horsepower to better handle the demands of off-road racing. One
								of the most iconic Porsche 911 rally cars is the Porsche 911
								Carrera RS 2.7. It achieved considerable success in the early
								1970s, winning events like the Tour de France Automobile and the
								Monte Carlo Rally. The Porsche 911's rear-engine layout and
								excellent weight distribution gave it an advantage in
								challenging rally conditions. Porsche's success in rally racing
								led to the creation of the Porsche 959, a groundbreaking
								supercar that was designed with both on-road and off-road
								capabilities. The Porsche 959 participated in the grueling
								Paris-Dakar Rally in the mid-1980s and showcased the brand's
								commitment to rally competition.

								<img src="./images/gtSport.png" width="200" alt="[gtSport]" />
								&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;Porsche has a long and storied history
								in GT motorsport, with numerous successes in various
								championships and endurance races. The brand's commitment to GT
								racing is evident through its participation in series such as
								the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), IMSA WeatherTech
								SportsCar Championship, and the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans.
								One of Porsche's most successful GT racing models is the Porsche
								911 GT3. Derived from the iconic 911 sports car, the GT3 variant
								is designed specifically for track performance. It has achieved
								numerous victories in GT championships around the world,
								including the WEC and IMSA GTLM class. The Porsche 911 RSR is
								another notable GT racing car from the brand. This model is
								built to comply with FIA GT regulations and has proven to be
								highly competitive in endurance races like the 24 Hours of Le
								Mans. The 911 RSR has claimed multiple class victories in Le
								Mans and has been a strong contender in other endurance events.
								In recent years, Porsche expanded its GT racing program with the
								introduction of the Porsche 911 GT3 R. This customer racing
								version of the GT3 is designed for privateer teams and has been
								successful in various GT3 championships worldwide, such as the
								Blancpain GT Series and the Intercontinental GT Challenge.

							<h3>le mans</h3>
							<p>
								<img src="./images/leMans.png" width="200" alt="[leMans]" />
								&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;Porsche has a legendary history at the
								24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the most prestigious endurance races
								in the world. The brand's participation and success in this race
								have solidified its reputation as a dominant force in
								motorsport. Porsche's first overall victory at Le Mans came in
								1970 with the Porsche 917K. The 917 models continued to be
								successful, with Porsche securing four more overall wins in
								1971, 1976, 1977, and 1979. These victories established Porsche
								as a major contender in endurance racing and helped cement the
								917's status as an iconic racing car. After a hiatus from the
								top category of racing, Porsche returned to Le Mans in the 1980s
								with the Porsche 956 and its successor, the Porsche 962. These
								Group C prototypes were dominant in their era, and between 1982
								and 1987, Porsche claimed six consecutive overall victories at
								Le Mans with the 956 and 962 models. Porsche's next era of
								success at Le Mans came in the 1990s with the Porsche 911 GT1.
								In 1996, Porsche introduced the 911 GT1-96, a purpose-built race
								car that blended elements of GT and prototype racing. It went on
								to secure an overall victory at Le Mans in the same year,
								marking Porsche's return to the winner's circle after an absence
								of 17 years.
